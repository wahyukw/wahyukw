## 🚀 About Me

I'm transitioning into iOS development with a passion for building elegant mobile applications. Coming from a professional background in **Strategy & Operations (Ex-Grab, Moladin)**, I bring a unique, disciplined, and **data-driven approach** to software quality and execution.

- 📱 **Currently building:** **Bagirata**, a complex Bill Splitting App leveraging the **Swift Observation Framework** for state management and **Unit Testing** for quality.
- 🌱 **Currently mastering:** **XCTest** (Unit Testing), Advanced Concurrency, and **Clean Architecture** patterns.
- 💪 **Outside of coding:** Hitting the gym, gaming, exploring new restaurants, and traveling
- 💼 **Status:** Actively seeking junior iOS developer roles (remote or Indonesia-based)
- 💬 **Ask me about:** My journey from Operations to Engineering, state management challenges, or tech gear!

### 📂 Featured Projects

#### 💵 Bagirata (Featured Project)

**A functional, state-driven Bill Splitting Application (MVP)**.

**Tech Stack:** Swift, SwiftUI, **Swift Observation Framework**, Unit Testing (XCTest).

* **Advanced State Management:** Architected the data flow using the **`@Observable`** system to manage state transitions across multi-step navigation.
* **Structured Navigation:** Mastered contemporary **Navigation principles** by implementing `NavigationStack` and `.navigationDestination` for fluid view transitions.
* **Quality & Integrity:** Ensured data persistence and integrity during complex view lifecycle events; includes **XCTest** integration for core business logic validation.

🔗 [Project 4 - Bagirata](https://github.com/wahyukw/Bagirata)

#### 🎬 StreamFlix (Featured Project)

**A functional, concurrently-driven Movie and TV Series Streaming Catalogue (MVP)**.

**Tech Stack:** Swift, SwiftUI, **Swift Concurrency (Async/Await)**, **Observation Framework**, RESTful API, **Protocol Oriented Programming**.

* **Concurrency Architecture (Async/Await)**: Architected a robust, layered concurrency system (@MainActor, actor, async let) to efficiently manage background network decoding and UI updates, ensuring a responsive user experience.
* **High-Efficiency Data Loading**: Implemented parallel loading using async let within the HomeViewModel to fetch multiple data streams (Trending Movies, Top Rated TV, etc.) simultaneously, dramatically reducing initial load time.
* **Scalable State & Navigation**: Utilized the modern @Observable framework for reactive state propagation and integrated Tabviews for fluid navigation across multiple pages.
* **Robust Data Handling**: Implemented Infinite Scrolling (Pagination) logic within ViewModels to handle discovery endpoints, loading additional content on demand to conserve bandwidth and memory.
